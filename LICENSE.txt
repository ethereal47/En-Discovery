License Summary:
This repository contains the original derivation, simulation, and symbolic exploration of the constant:

    En = sqrt(ln(pi) / ln(e / (e - 1)))

This constant was derived and analyzed by Ethan Berney and is made available for research, academic study, and symbolic exploration.
